# Draggable Sheet

`Draggable Sheet` is a highly customizable Flutter package that allows developers to easily implement a draggable bottom sheet into their Flutter applications. Inspired by Flutter's built-in `DraggableScrollableSheet`, this package extends its capabilities with enhanced features and greater flexibility, making it ideal for creating fully responsive and interactive bottom sheets.

## Features

- **Customizable Max and Min Heights**: Set the maximum and minimum heights that the sheet can expand or collapse to.
- **Scrollable Content Support**: Seamless integration with scrollable widgets like `ListView`, `GridView`, and `SingleChildScrollView`.
- **Snapping**: Optionally enable snapping behavior at different heights.
- **Callbacks**: Events for drag start, dragging, and drag end for better control over sheet behavior.
- **Custom Animation Curves**: Customize the animation curve for the expanding and collapsing motions.
- **Highly Configurable**: Extensive options to control the look and behavior of the draggable sheet.

## Getting Started

To get started with `Draggable Sheet`, add the package to your Flutter project by including it in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  draggable_sheet: ^1.0.0
```

Then, import the package in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:draggable_sheet/draggable_sheet.dart';
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use `Draggable Sheet` in your application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:draggable_sheet/draggable_sheet.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Draggable Sheet Example')),
        body: DraggableSheet(
          minChildSize: 0.1,
          maxChildSize: 0.8,
          initialChildSize: 0.5,
          builder: (context, scrollController) {
            return ListView.builder(
              controller: scrollController,
              itemCount: 25,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) => ListTile(title: Text('Item $index')),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Parameters

- `minChildSize`: The minimum size of the sheet as a fraction of the screen height.
- `maxChildSize`: The maximum size of the sheet as a fraction of the screen height.
- `initialChildSize`: The initial size of the sheet when the widget is first built.
- `builder`: A function that returns the widget displayed inside the sheet. It provides a `ScrollController` for integrating with scrollable content.
